# This repository is a simple project I learnt from HenryWebDev (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgFd17fyM4A)

Using React, React Context + useReducer, react-bootstrap.

#### Usage
1. `npm i` to install all the npm package.
2. `cd server` to move to server folder, then run `yarn server` to make the server run.
3. `cd client` to move to client folder, then run `yarn start` to make the client run.
